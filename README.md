# ParticleLife
Particle interaction system in my custom engine (OpenGL + Imgui)



## Installation

This project uses visual studio 2019 and the dependencies listed below.
I will try to add a guide in the future for the compilation of the dependencies.
Another version of this project made with cmake is available ![here](https://github.com/gabriel-combe/ParticlesLife_cmake)

## Usage example

Launch the visual studio solution and compile the project.
To change the parameters of the particles, directly change the attraction coefficients in the code.

> Need to add Imgui interaction to manage the particles

## Dependencies
- [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)
- [Glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad)
- [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
- [ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/docking)

## Thoughts

I am not pleased by this version as it does not compile the dependencies itself, and the particle system needs some improvments.
